1
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:14,474
Helen Walters: Last week,
US President Biden

2
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:17,794
and Xi Jinping, the president
of the People's Republic of China,

3
00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:20,754
met at the APEC Summit in San Francisco.

4
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,034
The meeting was notable
for being the first time

5
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:25,274
that Xi had visited the US in six years

6
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:28,714
and the first time the two leaders
have met in person in a year.

7
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:31,234
Now, obviously, what goes on
between these two nations

8
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:32,714
matters to everyone.

9
00:00:32,714 --> 00:00:36,434
So we found ourselves post-summit
with a bunch of follow-up questions,

10
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:40,274
and we've turned to our resident
geopolitical expert, Ian Bremmer,

11
00:00:40,314 --> 00:00:43,474
to help us understand
what to pay attention to and why.

12
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:44,754
Ian, hi.

13
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,914
Ian Bremmer: Helen,
good to be back with you.

14
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,234
HW: OK, so let's get right to it.

15
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:52,074
These are, alas, not peaceful times.

16
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:55,474
And I think it's safe to say
that the meeting between these two leaders

17
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:58,114
felt perhaps even more momentous
than it might have done

18
00:00:58,154 --> 00:01:01,594
were war not raging everywhere,
from the Middle East to Ukraine.

19
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:02,834
So tell us,

20
00:01:02,874 --> 00:01:06,274
what happened in San Francisco,
and what stood out most to you?

21
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:08,474
IB: Well, look, that is the backdrop.

22
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:14,994
That this is a world of unprecedented
geopolitical danger and risk.

23
00:01:14,994 --> 00:01:21,074
And the efforts are not in trying
to make everything better.

24
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:27,274
It's rather to try to stop the existing
conflicts from getting much worse.

25
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:32,034
And that is absolutely the macro focus

26
00:01:32,074 --> 00:01:37,274
that both President Biden
and President Xi bring to the meeting.

27
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:41,994
I mean, there's a lot to discuss around
the issues around US-China relations.

28
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:43,514
I'm sure we'll get to that.

29
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:45,034
But, you know, it's interesting

30
00:01:45,074 --> 00:01:49,514
that insofar as the Americans and Chinese
are actually on opposite sides

31
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:53,714
of the two major global conflicts
in the world right now.

32
00:01:53,754 --> 00:01:55,314
On Russia-Ukraine,

33
00:01:55,354 --> 00:02:00,674
the Chinese are the close friends,
without limits, to Vladimir Putin,

34
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:03,194
while the Americans
are providing more support

35
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:06,154
than any other country
in the world, militarily, to Ukraine.

36
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:11,074
The Chinese have not condemned Hamas
for their terrorist attacks.

37
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:16,074
The United States finds Israel
its most important and enduring ally

38
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:17,274
in the Middle East.

39
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:19,114
So you would think, Helen,

40
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:24,394
that this would be an area of contention
between the United States and China.

41
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:25,874
It's not.

42
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:30,434
Both the Americans and Chinese
are deeply concerned

43
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:33,754
that these conflicts
are going to get worse.

44
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,234
And they don't want that.

45
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:39,554
They want to find ways
to contain these conflicts.

46
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:42,274
And I think it's a very important point,

47
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:45,034
because we hear a lot about, you know,

48
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:48,754
Americans looking for adversaries
around the world

49
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:54,434
and lumping in China
with countries like Russia, Iran,

50
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,834
North Korea.

51
00:02:55,874 --> 00:03:00,354
And those other countries
are rogue states.

52
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:01,914
They're pariahs.

53
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:04,754
They're countries that benefit from chaos.

54
00:03:04,794 --> 00:03:08,434
They want to take advantage
of vacuums geopolitically.

55
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:14,994
Where the Americans and Chinese actually
geopolitically have a lot more in common,

56
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,034
in addition to the fact that they have
a lot of interdependence,

57
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:23,354
they also both benefit from a global
backdrop that is stable.

58
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:26,754
They want relatively free
and open trade of goods.

59
00:03:26,794 --> 00:03:28,834
They want a global economy that's working.

60
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,474
They don't want political
instability everywhere

61
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:33,674
or social instability everywhere.

62
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,594
And so even though
the United States and China

63
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:41,714
have different preferred end-states
for Russia-Ukraine

64
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:45,194
and for Israel-Gaza,

65
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:47,234
in the near-term,

66
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:49,914
you've got two leaders
that are meeting and saying,

67
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:51,794
how do we stop this from getting worse?

68
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:56,354
And that ended up being a significant
piece of the conversation,

69
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:59,874
the four-hour, three-session conversations

70
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:02,274
that Presidents Biden and Xi were having.

71
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:05,114
In some ways, maybe
the most important takeaway

72
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:08,194
that the two most powerful
countries in the world

73
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:12,314
are not looking at the Middle East
and Russia-Ukraine

74
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:14,434
through a lens of cold war,

75
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:17,594
but instead are looking at it
through the lens of,

76
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:20,074
"Oh my God, this is really a problem.

77
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:23,914
And are there anything that we can do,
individually or collectively

78
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:28,834
or with our friends and allies
in the regions,

79
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:34,674
that might help to stop this
from getting much, much worse?"

80
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:39,234
HW: Can you say any more
about what that actually looks like?

81
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:41,034
What might those alignments be?

82
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:44,154
IB: Well, in the case of the Middle East,

83
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:49,674
China has a relationship with Iran
that the United States does not have.

84
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:54,274
And both the American cabinet
as well as Biden directly

85
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:56,954
have been talking to the Chinese

86
00:04:56,994 --> 00:04:59,874
about getting messages to the Iranians

87
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:03,794
to help ensure that they don’t get
directly involved in the war

88
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:07,754
and that they limit the support
that they have given

89
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:10,994
to proxies in the region

90
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:14,634
that could, for example,
not only expand the war,

91
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:19,514
but also lead to challenges
in global energy supply.

92
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:25,394
You know, the Americans
sent two carrier strike groups

93
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:30,034
to the Eastern Med and the Persian Gulf

94
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:35,474
almost immediately after
the October 7 terrorist attacks.

95
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:39,914
China has destroyers in the region,

96
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:41,954
and they were there
for military exercises.

97
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:45,554
They’ve kept them there, and
they’ve expanded the military presence.

98
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,354
Not to fight the Americans

99
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:51,994
but rather to show
that the Chinese want to ensure

100
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:57,794
that there is not a fight in the region

101
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:00,394
that would suddenly prevent energy

102
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,434
from getting through
the Straits of Hormuz,

103
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:03,594
a critical choke point.

104
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:06,914
So, you know, frankly,
there's more alignment on this issue.

105
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:11,274
The Chinese also, just earlier today,
as you and I are talking,

106
00:06:11,274 --> 00:06:16,354
hosting a group of foreign ministers
from the Muslim world,

107
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:18,874
including the Palestinian Authority,

108
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:23,794
they're talking about a ceasefire
and a two-state solution.

109
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,914
Biden wants an extended
humanitarian pause,

110
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,314
not a ceasefire,

111
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,994
but also a two-state solution.

112
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:32,674
There's been a lot of conversation

113
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:37,394
around trying to bring
Middle Eastern countries

114
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:42,594
to be more constructive in helping
to ensure stability in this conflict.

115
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,274
So around the Middle East,

116
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:46,714
there's been a lot,
because it's more recent,

117
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:50,154
and because it’s frankly
more geopolitically dangerous --

118
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:54,754
the Russia-Ukraine war has more
knock-on economic implications --

119
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:59,114
but the Middle East conflict
is much more geopolitically fraught

120
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:03,794
in the sense that you could have
a religious war from, you know,

121
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:06,794
Ecuador to Indonesia.

122
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:10,674
Because you could have, you know,

123
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:13,954
they could have a much greater impact
on the US presidential election,

124
00:07:13,994 --> 00:07:15,634
for example.

125
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:19,914
That is one that is driving
a lot more direct attention

126
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:23,474
and engagement from the American
and Chinese leaders together.

127
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:26,594
HW: So I think it's interesting
and heartening

128
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:29,314
that stability might be
a watchword at this moment.

129
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,114
The US and China,

130
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:35,234
they obviously subscribe to very
different political systems.

131
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:39,154
And I think of a quote from
the MIT economist Yasheng Huang,

132
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:40,434
who was once quoted saying

133
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:44,874
that the two countries kind of got married
without knowing one another's religions.

134
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:47,114
How much did this summit, if anything,

135
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:50,114
do to address the root causes
of the tension?

136
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,074
IB: You know, it's interesting.

137
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:56,274
I see the analogy of US
and China getting married

138
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:58,714
without knowing the families

139
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:01,314
or the religions or any
of the other, you know,

140
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:07,034
sort of red lines that one connects with
when you make that lifetime bond.

141
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:12,314
But, you know, I've always
thought of it as a couple,

142
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:15,674
that the love has left the relationship,

143
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:17,514
but they have children together,

144
00:08:17,554 --> 00:08:19,794
and they love the children very much,

145
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:23,834
and they both want to make sure
that the children aren't hurt.

146
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:27,834
And so as a consequence, as much
as we can talk about, you know,

147
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:31,514
derisking as a term of art, or decoupling,

148
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:36,274
and these countries having very different
political and economic systems,

149
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:39,154
and they don’t particularly
trust each other,

150
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:42,914
and yet they know they need
to work together.

151
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:48,114
So in a sense, they're adults,
geopolitically.

152
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:52,554
I mean, when you have the US and China
in a room at the highest level,

153
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:54,994
and here I'm not just talking
about the presidents,

154
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:58,434
I'm talking about, you know,
any of the cabinet meetings

155
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:03,314
that have happened
at great level and scope

156
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:06,674
over the past months
after really none at all

157
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:09,994
during the couple plus years of pandemic,

158
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:12,714
all of those meetings,
they haven't been easy,

159
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:14,754
they've frequently been tense,

160
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,194
but they have all been handled as adults,

161
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:19,914
handled as two parents

162
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:23,594
that know the children need
to be taken care of long-term.

163
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:25,794
And when I say the children,

164
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:28,914
I'm not disparaging other countries.

165
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:32,194
I'm really talking
about the collective interest,

166
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:35,314
the knock-on interests
that come from what happens

167
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:41,114
if the US-China relationship suddenly
becomes one of cold war or worse,

168
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:45,914
which is absolutely plausible
in today's political environment.

169
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:50,154
So if that's the backdrop,

170
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:55,434
I think that Biden in particular spent
an enormous amount of time

171
00:09:55,434 --> 00:10:01,634
over the last six months
in preparation for this event,

172
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:06,394
trying to convince the Chinese
that the meeting would go well,

173
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:11,674
that the Americans were not planning
on dropping any surprises,

174
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:15,994
on undermining or embarrassing
their head of state

175
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:20,994
when he showed up on American turf
in San Francisco.

176
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:24,034
They were very concerned about that
because there's no trust,

177
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:27,314
and because there are plenty of issues
of significant tension

178
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:28,754
between the two countries.

179
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,674
And I think that they succeeded
critically in that.

180
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,354
Again, we haven't talked yet
about the specific issues,

181
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:35,994
and I know we'll get to them.

182
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,434
But the macro backdrop is important.

183
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:40,634
Over the last couple of months,

184
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:44,074
China has been on a charm offensive,

185
00:10:44,114 --> 00:10:45,354
with the Australians,

186
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:49,354
inviting the Australian prime minister
for a state visit to China

187
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:50,714
just a few weeks ago.

188
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:53,074
That went extremely well

189
00:10:53,074 --> 00:10:56,594
with expanded trade and energy agreements

190
00:10:56,594 --> 00:11:00,514
on the back of, you know, a relationship
where they weren't talking to each other,

191
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:02,354
where they were cutting off business,

192
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:05,234
where they were engaging
in massive tariffs and sanctions.

193
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,914
That's seen a breakthrough.

194
00:11:07,954 --> 00:11:10,074
I've seen some of that in South Korea.

195
00:11:10,114 --> 00:11:12,194
I've seen some of that with the Japanese.

196
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:13,674
And over a one-hour meeting

197
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:17,154
between Prime Minister Kishida
and Xi Jinping in person

198
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:20,714
at the APEC Summit, first time
in over a year that they have met.

199
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:22,394
I've seen that with the Europeans.

200
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:27,314
I've also seen it with a large number
of American and European CEOs

201
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,754
who have reported individually

202
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:33,314
just how much more access they've gotten,

203
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:37,194
welcoming they've gotten
from their trips to Beijing,

204
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:39,034
positive press coverage,

205
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:41,994
movement on issues
that have mattered to them,

206
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:47,274
all of which a sense that a better
Biden relationship with Xi Jinping,

207
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:49,514
not a breakthrough, not an entente,

208
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:52,194
but simply a commitment

209
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:55,634
that the US wants a more stable
baseline relationship

210
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,714
and would work towards that,

211
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:59,354
in San Francisco,

212
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:02,914
that gave the Chinese
leadership permission

213
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:07,554
to engage in this charm offensive
with other countries

214
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,194
and with the private sector.

215
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:12,914
And why was that so important?

216
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:16,114
Well, first, because it lowers
the temperature of the relationship.

217
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:21,154
It makes sudden, unsuspected crises
less likely to occur,

218
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:22,474
but also critically,

219
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:26,594
because the Chinese economy
is underperforming dramatically.

220
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:30,314
For many reasons, maybe most structurally,

221
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:34,714
because 50 years of China
acting as the world's factory,

222
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:37,714
with all of this inexpensive labor, well,

223
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:40,354
you don't need all
that inexpensive labor anymore.

224
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:43,754
And by the way, that labor
is not so inexpensive anymore.

225
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:47,394
And, you know, China hasn't become
an open-governance system.

226
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,754
They haven't moved towards rule of law.

227
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:51,954
And the Chinese competitors
are a lot stronger,

228
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:53,874
and their demographics are challenging.

229
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,194
And they've got lots of nonperforming debt

230
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,234
and their real estate sector's in trouble.

231
00:12:58,274 --> 00:13:00,674
And zero-COVID went really badly.

232
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:01,874
And then they unwound it

233
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:04,754
but the consumers don't feel
like they've got, you know,

234
00:13:04,794 --> 00:13:06,634
animal spirits driving them right now.

235
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:08,234
And I can keep going.

236
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:12,274
But the point is that China
is severely underperforming

237
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:15,394
in a way that, frankly,
we haven't seen structurally

238
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:19,674
since globalization
bringing the Chinese in,

239
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:22,194
you know, really got moving
in the '70s and '80s.

240
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:23,674
So in other words, Helen,

241
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:27,874
you and I have never seen
this structural economic headwinds

242
00:13:27,914 --> 00:13:29,514
on so many fronts in China.

243
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:33,794
And the Chinese are much more
aware of that than you and I are.

244
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:37,914
So they're very strongly incented,

245
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:42,514
even if they fully intend to take
Taiwan over the long-term

246
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:45,194
and they want to be the leading
economy in the world

247
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:47,554
and they want to dominate
artificial intelligence

248
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:51,794
and all of these things that Americans
and others worry about.

249
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:56,314
For the near and foreseeable,
medium-term future,

250
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:59,074
they’ve got to just right the boat.

251
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:01,274
They've got to get things stable.

252
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:03,394
They don't want a big fight right now.

253
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:08,154
And so I think that the Americans,
being a little more confident,

254
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:10,114
a little less concerned about, you know,

255
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:12,954
sort of, China taking over
everything in the near-term

256
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:15,514
and wanting to stabilize things,

257
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,874
really got you a lot more

258
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:21,834
than you would have otherwise expected
from this summit meeting

259
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,754
over the last several days.

260
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:28,034
HW: So it’s interesting to hear you talk
about the economic dysfunction in China.

261
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,914
And of course, I think it’s safe to say

262
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:33,154
that America is experiencing
pretty significant political dysfunction

263
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:34,314
at the moment.

264
00:14:34,354 --> 00:14:36,354
But what often goes unremarked is the fact

265
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:38,394
that President Biden
is actually extending,

266
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:42,434
perhaps doubling down, on President
Trump’spolicies when it comes to China.

267
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:44,514
So given that next year
is an election year,

268
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:45,914
what should we make of that?

269
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:48,354
And do you think
that the policies will continue?

270
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:49,994
IB: First of all, that backdrop,

271
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:54,594
that right now, China's in probably
the worst economic position structurally

272
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:57,154
that they've been in in 40, 50 years.

273
00:14:57,154 --> 00:15:00,474
But their political consolidation
around Xi is completely uncontested.

274
00:15:00,514 --> 00:15:02,714
And certainly XI Jinping
feels very comfortable

275
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:04,554
that he's consolidated a lot of power.

276
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:06,474
The United States, exactly the opposite.

277
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,194
The US coming out of the pandemic,

278
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:13,194
by far in the strongest economic position
of any advanced industrial economy

279
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:15,994
in terms of growth,
in terms of productivity,

280
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:18,594
in terms of leading in technologies

281
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:22,954
and in terms of lower
inflation than its peers.

282
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:27,394
But the US political system
is more dysfunctional,

283
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:30,274
more divided than at any
point in our lifetimes.

284
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:31,874
And for now,

285
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:36,314
that certainly is creating
a level of risk aversion

286
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:38,234
on the American side as well.

287
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:40,074
So I do think that, you know,

288
00:15:40,114 --> 00:15:42,514
at the same time that you hear
a lot of people say,

289
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:45,394
"Oh, if things go really badly,
maybe they want to lash out."

290
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:48,954
Yeah, not for these two leaders
at this point in time.

291
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:51,954
Other leaders, different countries,
different positions, maybe.

292
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,714
But that's not the way that this
is actually playing out.

293
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:56,234
Now 2024 is coming out,

294
00:15:56,234 --> 00:16:00,434
and people are certainly starting
to talk a lot more about it.

295
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:03,314
It's interesting that, as you point out,

296
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:09,674
the United States on China have policies
that are fairly consistent

297
00:16:09,714 --> 00:16:12,194
across the board politically.

298
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:14,754
Which is not true for most other issues.

299
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:17,954
If Trump became president,
Ukraine policy would be very different.

300
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:19,954
Iran policy would be very different.

301
00:16:19,994 --> 00:16:22,194
Europe policy would be very different.

302
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:24,394
China, not so different.

303
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:27,914
There's a lot of consistency
between Biden and Trump on China.

304
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:30,234
A lot of people thought
Biden was going to remove

305
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:32,514
the Trump tariffs on the Chinese.

306
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:33,674
He did no such thing.

307
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:36,314
In fact, he largely extended some of them.

308
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:40,354
Furthermore, export controls
on semiconductors,

309
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:43,674
pretty minimal from
the Trump administration,

310
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:46,474
expanded structurally under Biden

311
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:50,914
to the extent that China now really feels
like America wants to contain them

312
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:54,754
in the most advanced areas
of the 21-century economy.

313
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:58,394
And the US is also leaning
into industrial policy,

314
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,634
like the CHIPS Act,

315
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:04,234
domestically and with countries
like South Korea and the Netherlands.

316
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:09,314
The Chinese clearly would prefer
a Trump policy on China there,

317
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:11,434
than they do the Biden administration.

318
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:14,554
And, you know, you can tell this
when you talk to Chinese leaders,

319
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:17,234
compared to leaders
of other countries around the world,

320
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:19,594
most of whom have
pretty strong preferences

321
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:22,794
of whether Biden or Trump is president,

322
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,234
of who they want.

323
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:25,954
The Chinese aren't sure.

324
00:17:26,394 --> 00:17:30,034
The Chinese are thinking, well,
I mean, if Trump comes in,

325
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:35,034
there's greater likelihood that American
allies are going to be less aligned

326
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:39,274
because he'll push them transactionally
on spending more money on defense

327
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:43,034
or maybe he doesn't care
about the Japanese or the South Koreans,

328
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:47,194
and he'll put tariffs or threaten
tariffs on anybody, friends or enemies.

329
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:49,714
Biden's less likely to do that.

330
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:55,674
But Trump is also a wild card
on negative tail risks

331
00:17:55,714 --> 00:17:57,634
directly with the Chinese.

332
00:17:57,634 --> 00:18:00,794
You know, he was the guy that was willing
to work with North Korea,

333
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:03,954
but also was prepared to hit them
harder if things don't go well.

334
00:18:03,954 --> 00:18:06,794
Well, how lucky did the Chinese feel?

335
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,954
And I think, you know, the answer
you get is we really don't know.

336
00:18:09,994 --> 00:18:11,954
We don't know who we want there.

337
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:16,234
So there's a lot of uncertainty
that the Chinese have

338
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:19,434
about the future
of the American political system.

339
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:23,154
And there's a lot of uncertainty
that the Americans have

340
00:18:23,194 --> 00:18:26,954
about the future of the Chinese
economic system.

341
00:18:27,354 --> 00:18:32,634
At a time when the interdependence
of these two economies

342
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:36,474
and, frankly, of their
diplomatic interdependence,

343
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:39,394
is remaining quite high-level.

344
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:41,474
We may not be comfortable
with that reality,

345
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:43,354
but that is the abiding reality

346
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:45,834
that we're going to have
to deal with going forward.

347
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:47,994
HW: So you mentioned technology,

348
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:51,074
and I think that we have to talk
about artificial intelligence.

349
00:18:51,074 --> 00:18:53,554
Now, one of the major
breaking stories this weekend

350
00:18:53,554 --> 00:18:57,274
was the management implosions
and excitement over at OpenAI.

351
00:18:57,274 --> 00:19:00,034
And I'm sure we could have
a whole conversation about that.

352
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:03,834
But given the implications of AI
rolling out at every level of society,

353
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:06,594
where are the Chinese
and the US governments on this?

354
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:08,834
And what did they talk
about in San Francisco?

355
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:10,674
IB: Well, in San Francisco,

356
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:15,114
they spoke about starting
a track 1.5 working group

357
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,954
on artificial intelligence,

358
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:21,954
which means the private sector
and the public sector engaging together.

359
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:24,234
Which makes sense
from the American perspective,

360
00:19:24,274 --> 00:19:27,754
because, you know, the US is a country

361
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:30,234
that really does promote
entrepreneurialism

362
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:31,994
and its private sector corporations,

363
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:34,154
so much so that a lot of people think

364
00:19:34,194 --> 00:19:36,274
the US is less democratic
than it should be,

365
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:38,434
because corporations, private sector,

366
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:42,634
capture the regulatory process
through big money lobbying and the rest.

367
00:19:42,674 --> 00:19:46,594
The Chinese, of course, if anything,
the state captures the private sector.

368
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:50,194
So the fact that they're willing to have
not just government-to-government,

369
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:53,434
but government-to-government
plus these big companies

370
00:19:53,434 --> 00:19:56,074
that are, you know, effectively sovereign

371
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:58,434
when we talk about the digital space,

372
00:19:58,474 --> 00:20:00,954
the platforms they have,
the algorithms they drive

373
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:03,834
and artificial intelligence
that they are rolling out

374
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:05,234
very, very quickly.

375
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:08,194
That's a fairly significant move.

376
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:11,234
And it comes on the back
of the Americans and Chinese

377
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:16,114
both sending senior officials
to Bletchley Park in the UK,

378
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:21,834
agreeing to a set of principles
on safety for frontier AI models,

379
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:25,074
the AI models that are coming
in the future.

380
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:29,674
So there is a level of understanding
between the US and China

381
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:31,754
that they need to share information,

382
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:33,234
and they need to work together

383
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:38,234
to avoid some of the worst
negative potentials

384
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,474
from very disruptive AI,

385
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:44,114
while obviously benefiting
from extraordinary, you know,

386
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:48,754
sort of, world-changing new productivity,
invention and efficiency.

387
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:52,514
But there's a really,
really big unknown question

388
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:55,114
that underpins the rolling out of AI.

389
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:58,234
Because let's think
about what AI does today.

390
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:00,114
It's taking, it's these models,

391
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:01,874
these large language models,

392
00:21:01,914 --> 00:21:05,794
that are taking the entire
corpus of global data,

393
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,874
as we have it on the internet,

394
00:21:07,874 --> 00:21:10,434
as we have it in the digital world,

395
00:21:10,474 --> 00:21:13,874
and is making predictions,

396
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:15,954
pattern recognition and predictions,

397
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:19,754
on the basis of all
of that information instantaneously.

398
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:23,034
And we've never had such powerful tools.

399
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:28,274
Now, when you have
all of that data at your fingertips,

400
00:21:28,314 --> 00:21:32,434
so you can therefore assess and measure

401
00:21:32,434 --> 00:21:35,954
metrics of the world in real time

402
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:40,394
and how human beings interact
with it in real-time,

403
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:43,554
that creates really big questions

404
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:48,314
about what political and economic models
will be most functional.

405
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,354
So, for example, 30 years ago,

406
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:54,474
you know, we thought,
well, democracy is definitely

407
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,194
the most functional model.

408
00:21:56,234 --> 00:22:00,034
And the internet, as it rolls out,
is making that more clear,

409
00:22:00,034 --> 00:22:01,754
because you've got all these people

410
00:22:01,794 --> 00:22:04,634
with their access to the World Wide Web,

411
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:07,034
and that really undermines
authoritarian countries

412
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,794
that want to control information
and it helps democracies.

413
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:12,714
And that's how you got
colored revolutions or the Arab Spring.

414
00:22:12,754 --> 00:22:15,914
And then you have the data revolution,
the surveillance revolution,

415
00:22:15,914 --> 00:22:17,314
you say, well, wait a second.

416
00:22:17,354 --> 00:22:19,954
You know, governments
that have access to all that data

417
00:22:19,954 --> 00:22:24,954
can actually create, you know,
all sorts of incentives,

418
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:29,434
both carrots and sticks,
to motivate patriotic behavior,

419
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:33,354
where in democracies that can create
a lot more polarization.

420
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:37,674
So now let's take AI and look forward

421
00:22:37,714 --> 00:22:41,274
three, five years, when you've got
large language models

422
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:46,914
that are tailored to your individual
data corpus on your smartphone.

423
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:51,434
So everyone has an individual AI
that has all the data on you,

424
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:55,354
and collectively it has all
the data on the planet real-time.

425
00:22:56,114 --> 00:22:58,394
In that environment,

426
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:02,794
is a planned economy
less efficient or more efficient

427
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:06,034
than a free-market economy

428
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:08,434
with different corporations
that are competing?

429
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,194
We don't know the answer.

430
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:11,674
In that environment,

431
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:16,514
is an authoritarian political system
more or less stable

432
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:18,714
than a democratic political system?

433
00:23:18,754 --> 00:23:20,474
We actually don't know the answer.

434
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:23,514
I mean, Helen, I know
the answer I want it to be.

435
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:27,034
I want it to be a well-regulated
free market and a democracy.

436
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,594
But I'd be lying to you, right?

437
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:31,594
We don't know the answer to that.

438
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:35,914
And so, I mean, suddenly,
the United States and China

439
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,834
are entering into a world

440
00:23:38,874 --> 00:23:43,514
where a small number of actors
in the private sector

441
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:46,274
are investing immense amounts of money

442
00:23:46,314 --> 00:23:49,434
and developing unprecedented tools

443
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:52,714
that will determine,
more than anything else,

444
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:55,514
the viability and strength

445
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:59,994
of these two fundamentally competing
political and economic models.

446
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:03,274
And we don't know which one
is going to do better.

447
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:06,474
Which one might even win,
or can they both exist,

448
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:08,474
continue to exist at the same time.

449
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,274
And so in that environment,

450
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:14,274
you better believe that the Americans
and Chinese both want to have,

451
00:24:14,314 --> 00:24:19,634
you know, a very significant seat
at the head of the table

452
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:23,154
in helping understand what the hell
is going on with AI.

453
00:24:23,874 --> 00:24:27,794
You need to know that early
so you have some time to plan for it,

454
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,474
to respond to it, to govern it,

455
00:24:29,474 --> 00:24:32,594
to create institutions
and structure around it.

456
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:36,354
And I think right now both
governments are playing catch-up,

457
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:40,594
but they understand they need to do it
hand in glove with the private sector.

458
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:41,834
And my God, I mean,

459
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:46,274
the events at OpenAI

460
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:50,274
are absolutely essential
to understanding that future.

461
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:55,474
HW: I mean, complexity
is the operative word there.

462
00:24:55,514 --> 00:24:56,994
I mean, what is the likelihood?

463
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:58,954
I mean, many speakers at TED have called

464
00:24:58,954 --> 00:25:03,554
for some form of international regulatory
agency or for some kind of oversight.

465
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:06,834
What are the chances that we could
actually see that actually happen,

466
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:09,394
and what are the chances
that it could have teeth?

467
00:25:09,994 --> 00:25:14,354
IB: Well, there are governments
all over the world

468
00:25:14,394 --> 00:25:17,714
that are treating this issue with urgency.

469
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:19,634
They're making it a priority.

470
00:25:19,634 --> 00:25:22,274
And they're doing that in part,

471
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:24,794
not only because they know
AI is important,

472
00:25:24,794 --> 00:25:27,874
but they also see that AI
is critically important to things

473
00:25:27,914 --> 00:25:30,034
that they're already prioritizing.

474
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:33,034
So if you look at Russia-Ukraine,

475
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:39,074
the future of that war
may well be critically determined

476
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:45,034
by the ability of the Ukrainians
to use autonomous lethal weapons

477
00:25:45,074 --> 00:25:47,394
powered by AI against Russia.

478
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:51,194
You better understand that
if you're the Americans

479
00:25:51,234 --> 00:25:53,714
and US allies going forward,

480
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:55,714
both in terms of getting outcomes you want

481
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,474
and also potentially
destabilizing the region

482
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:00,594
in ways that you're not prepared for.

483
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:06,754
The AI-driven disinformation
around the US election in 2024

484
00:26:06,794 --> 00:26:12,154
is an absolute critical concern
for US policy makers

485
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:17,594
and, frankly, around disinformation
for Israel-Palestine

486
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:20,034
and who wins the information war,

487
00:26:20,074 --> 00:26:23,354
which, I mean, the Israelis
are militarily doing

488
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:25,994
what they want to,
tactically on the ground,

489
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:29,234
but broader information war,
at least presently, they're losing.

490
00:26:30,514 --> 00:26:32,954
Understanding AI is critical
to all of these issues.

491
00:26:32,994 --> 00:26:34,914
It's not just a new space.

492
00:26:34,954 --> 00:26:38,474
And so I think everyone is taking
it very, very seriously.

493
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,874
And they're putting a lot
of resources into it.

494
00:26:41,674 --> 00:26:47,394
There clearly is a level of effort

495
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:53,634
to regulate AI in ways that align
with individual government goals

496
00:26:53,674 --> 00:26:55,354
and systems

497
00:26:55,354 --> 00:26:57,594
that is different from place to place.

498
00:26:57,594 --> 00:26:59,274
So, I mean, in China,

499
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:02,274
part of it is we can't allow

500
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:09,034
the average Chinese citizen to have access
to a chatbot that could provide,

501
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:11,514
you know, responses on any data.

502
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:13,994
You know, we can't allow --

503
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:16,634
there's got to be severe penalties

504
00:27:16,674 --> 00:27:20,154
in starting to talk
about independence of Taiwan

505
00:27:20,194 --> 00:27:23,034
or Tiananmen Square or anything like that.

506
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:27,954
And these companies have to be responsible
not just for the inputs

507
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:32,314
but also the outputs
that are coming from these platforms.

508
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:34,834
Where in the United States, right,

509
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:38,754
you have the companies
that are working very closely

510
00:27:38,794 --> 00:27:41,554
with the US government
to try to figure out,

511
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:45,274
OK, what are the areas
that we're going to be comfortable

512
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:48,074
having significant regulation.

513
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:49,314
Like for example,

514
00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:55,474
red teaming on how one
can break new models

515
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:57,194
as they're developed.

516
00:27:57,874 --> 00:28:02,794
Or in having watermarks
that help to determine

517
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:07,954
whether something is or is not
created by artificial intelligence.

518
00:28:07,954 --> 00:28:13,794
Where in Europe, the focus is so much more
on privacy and data protections

519
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:14,994
for citizens.

520
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:17,074
So, you know, right now,

521
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:19,834
you would say it looks
like they're moving in very,

522
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:21,474
very different directions.

523
00:28:21,474 --> 00:28:24,754
But that's in part
because we don't yet have

524
00:28:24,794 --> 00:28:27,514
anything close to global agreement

525
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:31,114
on what artificial intelligence can do.

526
00:28:31,154 --> 00:28:33,354
What are the things
that need to be measured,

527
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:35,594
what are the things
that we want to promote,

528
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:40,354
and what are the areas that we need to try
to contain or constrain or regulate?

529
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:43,714
And I think that there's
a United Nations process

530
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:44,914
that I'm involved in,

531
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:49,234
a high-level panel that I think is trying
to make immediate strides on that.

532
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:52,034
I mean, the report's going to come
out within eight months,

533
00:28:52,074 --> 00:28:55,994
which is light speed in terms
of the United Nations.

534
00:28:56,834 --> 00:29:01,074
But we will see
whether all of those efforts

535
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,314
will get you to pieces
of global governance

536
00:29:04,354 --> 00:29:07,994
like you have the beginnings
of for climate change, for example.

537
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:10,714
But you had decades to get it
together on climate change,

538
00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:14,034
and you have months to a few years
to do it effectively on AI.

539
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:18,034
I would say that I am hopeful,
but I am not yet optimistic.

540
00:29:19,154 --> 00:29:20,634
HW: All right, we'll take it.

541
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,154
OK, I want to change the topic.

542
00:29:22,154 --> 00:29:23,954
I want to talk about infrastructure.

543
00:29:23,954 --> 00:29:27,114
So the Belt and Road Initiative
is subject to a lot of debate.

544
00:29:27,154 --> 00:29:30,554
And just as a quick background reminder
for those who don't know,

545
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:33,314
the Belt and Road Initiative
is one of the most ambitious

546
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:36,114
physical infrastructure projects
that was ever conceived.

547
00:29:36,154 --> 00:29:38,074
It was launched by Xi in 2013,

548
00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:43,234
and originally it was devised to link
East Asia and Europe,

549
00:29:43,234 --> 00:29:46,594
has since expanded to the Global South
and to Latin America.

550
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:49,714
Do you think that the US is losing
out to China in this regard?

551
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:53,154
And what should the US do to counter
potential China dominance

552
00:29:53,194 --> 00:29:54,954
in the Global South, particularly?

553
00:29:56,034 --> 00:30:01,514
IB: It’s certainly true that the Chinese
have far more influence

554
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:05,114
in terms of their commercial and trade
relations across the Global South

555
00:30:05,154 --> 00:30:06,394
than the Americans do.

556
00:30:06,434 --> 00:30:08,674
In part because they invest a lot more

557
00:30:08,714 --> 00:30:11,794
and in part because those investments
are driven much more

558
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:13,554
by the Chinese government.

559
00:30:14,154 --> 00:30:17,074
And that's because that's the nature
of the Chinese system.

560
00:30:17,074 --> 00:30:20,754
I mean, if Apple decides to invest
in India as opposed to China,

561
00:30:20,794 --> 00:30:25,714
that decision has virtually nothing
to do with the US government,

562
00:30:25,754 --> 00:30:27,074
maybe at the margins.

563
00:30:27,114 --> 00:30:28,714
But overwhelmingly,

564
00:30:28,754 --> 00:30:33,834
that decision is made by Apple
for reasons intrinsic to Apple.

565
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:37,234
Where if the Chinese are investing,

566
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:39,314
certainly if it's a state-
owned enterprise,

567
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:42,514
it's being coordinated strategically
with the Chinese government.

568
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:44,874
And even if it's a private-sector company,

569
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:47,554
there's a lot more alignment
with the Chinese.

570
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:48,914
So I'm saying that in part

571
00:30:48,954 --> 00:30:51,034
because there's some degree

572
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:54,434
to which this is not a winnable
fight by the Americans.

573
00:30:54,474 --> 00:30:58,914
The Chinese exert influence
around the world

574
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:02,034
through their state
capitalist system primarily.

575
00:31:02,074 --> 00:31:06,434
Their power is projected more
commercially than the United States,

576
00:31:06,474 --> 00:31:08,994
which historically has projected power,

577
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,994
a lot of soft power through
its political institutions

578
00:31:12,034 --> 00:31:13,874
and through its cultural institutions,

579
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:18,274
but also, of course, a lot of hard power
through its military might.

580
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:21,874
And then, of course, the role
of the US dollar as reserve currency,

581
00:31:21,874 --> 00:31:23,474
which allows you to weaponize it,

582
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,594
get countries to do
what they want that way,

583
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:28,074
but not through state-directed
trade and investment.

584
00:31:28,114 --> 00:31:30,954
So you could say the Chinese
are in the lead there,

585
00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:34,474
though I would argue
that the size of that lead

586
00:31:34,514 --> 00:31:36,194
has been overstated.

587
00:31:37,394 --> 00:31:41,954
In part because China is no longer
spending anywhere near as much

588
00:31:41,994 --> 00:31:44,394
on Belt and Road as they used to.

589
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:45,834
And that's one of the reasons

590
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:48,434
why a lot fewer heads of state
showed up a month ago

591
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,994
at their Belt and Road summit

592
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:53,754
than did during their summits
before the pandemic,

593
00:31:53,794 --> 00:31:56,714
because they just don't have
the same amount of money

594
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:59,954
that they are willing to throw
at these countries,

595
00:31:59,994 --> 00:32:03,354
but also because a lot
of the investments they made

596
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,194
did not perform very well.

597
00:32:05,554 --> 00:32:08,274
And as a consequence,
you've got a lot of bad debt

598
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:11,914
that now they have to restructure
in countries all over the world

599
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:14,194
where they have really,
really big exposures,

600
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:17,634
like Pakistan and like Zambia
and like Sri Lanka, I mean,

601
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:20,034
countries that 10 years ago, 15 years ago,

602
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:22,674
you were heralding as China's
taking over these places.

603
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:25,354
And then it's like, oh my God,
what are we dealing with?

604
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:26,554
Venezuela, right?

605
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:29,514
I mean, a lot of the countries
that the Chinese are dominating

606
00:32:29,554 --> 00:32:32,474
are some of the worst-performing
markets out there

607
00:32:32,474 --> 00:32:35,154
with debt that is going to be
incredibly hard to service,

608
00:32:35,194 --> 00:32:38,234
especially in a really challenging
interest rate environment.

609
00:32:38,554 --> 00:32:42,434
So I'm not so sure that that
Belt and Road, you know,

610
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:44,434
sort of, advantage is so critical,

611
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:47,314
especially because a lot
of that Belt and Road

612
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:49,954
is in hard infrastructure.

613
00:32:49,994 --> 00:32:52,034
And once you build it,
everyone can use it.

614
00:32:52,074 --> 00:32:53,994
You build a port, you build a railway.

615
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:57,314
I mean, I'd rather the Americans
build it than the Chinese

616
00:32:57,354 --> 00:33:00,274
because it redounds more
to American shareholders, sure.

617
00:33:00,274 --> 00:33:03,914
But you'd rather the port be built,
than no one build the port.

618
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:07,194
Because that then leads
to more economic growth.

619
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:09,594
And if the US is the largest
economy in the world,

620
00:33:09,594 --> 00:33:11,274
the US benefits disproportionately

621
00:33:11,314 --> 00:33:13,314
from more economic growth
around the world.

622
00:33:13,354 --> 00:33:14,794
That's just kind of a reality.

623
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:16,594
It's what globalization is all about.

624
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:20,034
But I'm not so sure,

625
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:24,994
when you talk about new technologies,
now it's a very different place.

626
00:33:25,034 --> 00:33:28,794
Now, the Americans
are leading the world in AI,

627
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:35,034
and the Chinese are leading the world
in transition energy technology:

628
00:33:35,074 --> 00:33:39,794
electric vehicles,
batteries, supply chain.

629
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:45,394
And we're seeing that play out
in the fight between the US and China.

630
00:33:45,434 --> 00:33:49,834
So there were some big positives
that came between Xi and Biden.

631
00:33:50,274 --> 00:33:53,674
You've got a lot of military-
to-military direct engagement

632
00:33:53,714 --> 00:33:56,434
in a high level that the Chinese
had resisted before.

633
00:33:56,474 --> 00:34:00,394
And so now the next time you have
an American and Chinese aircraft

634
00:34:00,434 --> 00:34:03,874
five feet next to each other,
near-miss or God forbid,

635
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:05,434
actually have a collision,

636
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:09,394
you'll have hot lines
to deconflict that immediately.

637
00:34:09,434 --> 00:34:10,874
And that's a good thing.

638
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:13,234
And on Taiwan, there were
a lot of conversations.

639
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:15,594
And now the two
opposition parties in Taiwan

640
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:17,954
look like they're going to run
on a joint ticket.

641
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:21,314
They still have to figure out
the final methodology on that.

642
00:34:21,354 --> 00:34:24,354
But if that happens, that means
the guy that, you know,

643
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:26,754
China thinks of as pro-independence,

644
00:34:26,794 --> 00:34:28,674
that would lead to a lot more tensions,

645
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:30,034
probably isn't going to win.

646
00:34:30,074 --> 00:34:31,634
That reduces near-term tensions.

647
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:32,794
That's a big issue.

648
00:34:32,794 --> 00:34:36,554
But the big area of conflict
that has not been addressed

649
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:40,714
and that is still moving towards
more confrontation is technology.

650
00:34:41,274 --> 00:34:47,434
And here the Americans are continuing
with existing export controls,

651
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:48,914
and they plan to expand them.

652
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:50,594
In fact, in the coming months,

653
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:55,074
I think you will see new export
controls on cloud computing.

654
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:59,954
And meanwhile, the Chinese
are responding with export controls

655
00:34:59,954 --> 00:35:01,714
in the critical minerals space.

656
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:04,434
They talked about gallium and germanium,

657
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:07,554
which, you know,
are pretty widely available

658
00:35:07,594 --> 00:35:11,434
and not so essential for so much
of that supply chain.

659
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:13,434
But now they're talking about graphite,

660
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:17,794
which is much more essential
for batteries, for EVs

661
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:20,034
and where the Chinese
have much more control.

662
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:25,034
And if those move from licenses
to direct controls,

663
00:35:25,074 --> 00:35:27,954
then you're going to have
a very significant fight

664
00:35:27,994 --> 00:35:33,194
between the United States
containing Chinese growth in AI

665
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:39,074
and the Chinese containing American
and allied growth in transition energy.

666
00:35:39,594 --> 00:35:41,874
That's the opposite of globalization.

667
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:43,314
It's less efficient.

668
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:45,154
It's more expensive, right?

669
00:35:45,194 --> 00:35:47,874
It's industrial policy,
it's not free market.

670
00:35:48,394 --> 00:35:53,714
And it will create a much more tense
structural relationship

671
00:35:53,754 --> 00:35:54,994
between the US and China.

672
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:58,714
This is the area that we need
to watch the most closely

673
00:35:58,754 --> 00:36:01,274
over the coming, say, six months.

674
00:36:01,314 --> 00:36:04,634
It's where we could end up getting
a much bigger blow up,

675
00:36:04,674 --> 00:36:08,794
despite the level of stability
that both sides are trying to achieve

676
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:09,954
in the relationship.

677
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:12,714
HW: So the mention of energy
is obviously salient.

678
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,874
And, you know, the COP conference
is coming up in Abu Dhabi

679
00:36:15,914 --> 00:36:17,074
in ten days' time.

680
00:36:17,114 --> 00:36:20,954
And so I'm wondering, did they
talk about climate policy?

681
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:22,434
Were they talking about energy?

682
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:23,834
What happened?

683
00:36:23,874 --> 00:36:27,394
IB: It was part of the run-up
to the summit where John Kerry,

684
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:33,314
on cabinet and special climate envoy
at state for the Biden administration,

685
00:36:33,314 --> 00:36:37,434
was meeting with his interlocutor
in the Chinese government.

686
00:36:37,474 --> 00:36:41,914
They've engaged a lot of late,
and there's a replacement there.

687
00:36:41,954 --> 00:36:45,714
So Kerry met with the replacement,
which is useful, younger,

688
00:36:45,754 --> 00:36:51,474
not as well-known globally,
but has the portfolio on the Chinese side.

689
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:57,234
And in the run-up
to the COP summit in Abu Dhabi,

690
00:36:57,274 --> 00:37:03,114
where, you know, the world comes together
to talk about commitments on climate,

691
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,514
there has been more
willingness of the Chinese

692
00:37:06,554 --> 00:37:11,194
to say that they will come up
with some joint plan

693
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:14,554
to further reduce emissions by 2030

694
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:18,514
and further invest in transition energy.

695
00:37:18,514 --> 00:37:21,274
But, you know, in reality,

696
00:37:21,274 --> 00:37:24,474
the US and China are fighting more

697
00:37:24,514 --> 00:37:26,074
or competing more

698
00:37:26,114 --> 00:37:29,954
than they are cooperating
in the climate space.

699
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:32,874
This is one where the Americans
looked at China

700
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:36,514
you know, no matter what you think
about climate change in the US,

701
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,634
no matter how much
of a tree hugger you are or aren't,

702
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:42,874
you see the Chinese
putting hundreds of billions

703
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:47,234
into new post-carbon technologies
and you say, wait a second,

704
00:37:47,274 --> 00:37:50,114
I can't let the Chinese dominate
the world in that.

705
00:37:50,954 --> 00:37:52,874
I want the Americans to do that.

706
00:37:52,914 --> 00:37:57,314
So there is, you know,
some sort of, you know,

707
00:37:57,354 --> 00:37:59,914
virtuous cycle of competition,

708
00:37:59,954 --> 00:38:02,634
even if it's not alignment
and coordination.

709
00:38:02,634 --> 00:38:06,954
Now, the alignment between
the US and China on climate

710
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:08,674
is a challenging alignment.

711
00:38:08,714 --> 00:38:11,834
It's one where the Chinese
are emitting by far

712
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,914
the most carbon in the world today.

713
00:38:14,234 --> 00:38:19,394
And the Americans have emitted by far
the most carbon in the world historically

714
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:23,394
and emit much more per capita
today than the Chinese do,

715
00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:26,274
though the Chinese per capita actually
emit more than Europe,

716
00:38:26,274 --> 00:38:27,554
which is quite something,

717
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:30,034
given how comparatively
poor the Chinese are.

718
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:32,834
You look at that and you say, well,

719
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:37,474
neither of these economies
really wants to spend a lot of money

720
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:40,594
admitting that they're
the ones responsible

721
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:45,394
and they have to be the ones paying
for loss and damages and transition

722
00:38:45,434 --> 00:38:48,834
for the poorer countries that haven't
had a chance to industrialize yet,

723
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:52,634
haven't had a chance to industrialize
with carbon intensity yet, right?

724
00:38:52,674 --> 00:38:56,714
And there are a lot of countries
around the world, especially India,

725
00:38:56,754 --> 00:38:58,634
but broadly the Global South,

726
00:38:58,674 --> 00:39:00,874
that really want a very different outcome.

727
00:39:00,914 --> 00:39:04,474
So, you know, China used to be
a member of the Global South.

728
00:39:05,074 --> 00:39:07,314
And this is one --
we haven't talked about this,

729
00:39:07,354 --> 00:39:09,794
but it's kind of a really
interesting point to make.

730
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:12,994
China is not a part of the Global
South anymore, right?

731
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:15,154
When they're the leading carbon emitter

732
00:39:15,194 --> 00:39:19,714
and they're the leading creditor
to the world's developing countries

733
00:39:19,714 --> 00:39:22,754
and they're increasingly --
and the second,

734
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:29,354
the second-lead technology country
in the world in terms of biotech

735
00:39:29,354 --> 00:39:33,194
and new energy and digital commerce

736
00:39:33,194 --> 00:39:35,794
and, you know, facial recognition,

737
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:39,274
you know, voice recognition,
the list goes on and on and on.

738
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:43,194
You know, China is not
a developed country,

739
00:39:43,234 --> 00:39:45,194
but they’re not in the Global South.

740
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:46,514
And part of the reason,

741
00:39:46,554 --> 00:39:49,514
to go back to what we talked about
at the beginning here,

742
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:51,994
part of the reason why
the Americans and the Chinese

743
00:39:51,994 --> 00:39:54,394
are the "adults" in the room

744
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:58,234
is precisely because they both
have so much at stake

745
00:39:58,234 --> 00:40:01,874
with the existing status quo remaining.

746
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:06,914
The Chinese want to change their level
of influence over existing institutions.

747
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:09,474
They want more voting rights
in the IMF, for example,

748
00:40:09,514 --> 00:40:11,754
but they don't want
to break those institutions.

749
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:13,674
They want them to persist.

750
00:40:13,674 --> 00:40:16,314
In fact, the Chinese, you know, see

751
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:18,634
that they're the largest
contributor in the world

752
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:20,714
to UN peacekeeping operations.

753
00:40:20,714 --> 00:40:24,114
That's an organization the Americans
created at the end of World War II.

754
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:26,194
But the Chinese are really
committed to it.

755
00:40:26,194 --> 00:40:28,834
Where the Russians,
I mean, you know, basically,

756
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:31,674
they're the ones
that are sending, you know,

757
00:40:31,714 --> 00:40:34,314
Wagner and their successors in

758
00:40:34,354 --> 00:40:37,794
to countries where nobody can participate.

759
00:40:37,794 --> 00:40:43,074
To, you know, literally,
to ungoverned regions of chaos.

760
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:46,954
So again, it's not
that we suddenly say, oh,

761
00:40:46,954 --> 00:40:49,234
China is a democracy
that we should really like,

762
00:40:49,234 --> 00:40:50,834
they're friendly, they're cuddly.

763
00:40:50,874 --> 00:40:52,034
No, no, no, not at all.

764
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:56,354
But they are really invested
in the present global system.

765
00:40:56,714 --> 00:41:00,634
And that is a piece of stability

766
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:04,074
at a time that a lot of the world
appears to be coming apart.

767
00:41:05,394 --> 00:41:07,914
HW: So one final question
and then we have to wrap up.

768
00:41:07,954 --> 00:41:11,594
And this question came from our community
who also sent in questions for you.

769
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,434
How did this meeting change
your outlook on future relations

770
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:16,154
between the US and China?

771
00:41:16,914 --> 00:41:21,594
IB: In the near term, it almost guarantees

772
00:41:21,634 --> 00:41:25,554
that US-China relations
will be more frequent

773
00:41:25,594 --> 00:41:28,314
and will be more constructive.

774
00:41:28,754 --> 00:41:32,794
That does not mean that there will be
massive breakthroughs,

775
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:37,074
but the willingness of both sides
to see that they benefit

776
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:39,554
when they engage
with each other substantively

777
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:43,074
at the highest levels
across all of the government.

778
00:41:43,074 --> 00:41:45,714
I mean, it's not just on, you know,

779
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:48,914
Gina Raimondo in Commerce
going over there and saying,

780
00:41:48,914 --> 00:41:50,474
"Hey, we want to make sure

781
00:41:50,514 --> 00:41:52,794
that Disney and the NBA
can still do business."

782
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:54,074
That's happening,

783
00:41:54,114 --> 00:41:55,754
it's much broader than that.

784
00:41:55,794 --> 00:42:00,354
It's climate, it's defense,
it's technology, it's the leaders.

785
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:03,154
And I'll tell you,
this wasn't in the talking points,

786
00:42:03,194 --> 00:42:04,554
but it is important

787
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:08,274
that Biden and Xi Jinping
privately did talk about the fact

788
00:42:08,274 --> 00:42:11,914
that they need to spend more time
with each other personally.

789
00:42:11,914 --> 00:42:14,874
And, you know, that Biden and Xi
knew each other quite well,

790
00:42:14,914 --> 00:42:17,554
spent a lot of time when they
were both vice presidents.

791
00:42:17,554 --> 00:42:19,954
And that's something
that Biden's pretty proud of.

792
00:42:19,994 --> 00:42:23,114
And he talks about it privately
in a way that, for example,

793
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:26,554
he never got to know Putin,
and he doesn’t like Putin.

794
00:42:26,594 --> 00:42:30,394
Xi Jinping, he may not trust him,
but he does respect him.

795
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:35,754
They actually do have a person-to-person
relationship that matters.

796
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:39,074
And, you know, for two leaders

797
00:42:39,114 --> 00:42:41,714
of the most powerful
countries in the world

798
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:45,554
that hadn't talked to each other
for such a long time,

799
00:42:45,594 --> 00:42:49,634
spending four hours together
really matters, face-to-face.

800
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:51,714
And I think we're going
to see more of that,

801
00:42:51,754 --> 00:42:54,554
at least by Zoom, over the coming months.

802
00:42:54,554 --> 00:42:55,874
And we should welcome that.

803
00:42:55,914 --> 00:42:59,034
Irrespective of what you think
of either or both of those leaders,

804
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,434
it's a very important thing
for them to be talking.

805
00:43:02,354 --> 00:43:05,474
HW: Ian, always a pleasure,
thank you so much for your time.

806
00:43:05,474 --> 00:43:06,674
IB: Thank you. Helen.
